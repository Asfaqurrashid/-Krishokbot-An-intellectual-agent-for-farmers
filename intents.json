When the prevalence of adult moths increases, the moth moths can be killed by collecting light traps 200-300 m away from the paddy field. In areas where the incidence of yellow mazara is high, if possible, the attack can be prevented by cultivating varieties of yellow mazara resistant varieties like Chandina (BR1).

Arrange to kill rats with the smell of burning pepper in rat holes. 04. Intensive trap leaves: Kill rats to get different types of traps. 05. Using Glue: A type of glue used for catching rats in warehouses or indoors is usually applied on wooden boards, thick cardboard, tin, and on the road where rats move. Good results are obtained. You have to put tempting food in the middle of the board. (B) Chemical suppression: This type of poisonous rat dies within a few hours of playing once. For example: Zinc phosphide (2%) mixed with wheat. Application Strategy: Zinc phosphide blended wheat is practiced for a few days and then suddenly one day <2% zinc phosphide blended wheat is given. Problem: Poisoning shyness can occur if the rats are not removed. After eating the poison, the rat dies. Seeing this, the reluctance of the living rat to eat that poison is the shame of the poison. Suitable time to control rats: 01. Before the harvest of any crop. At this time, the number of rats in the field and their food is less, so the rats eat bisatop easily. 02. The house is open throughout the year and during the rainy season. 03. Roads and dams during monsoon (when there is water in the field). 04. The first day of discharge in deep and shallow irrigation canals. Biological control method: This method includes the technique of controlling rats with organisms. Rats are killed by different types of natural enemies like fox, beji, wild cat, snake, guisap, pecha. Therefore, proper arrangements have to be made for the reproduction of rat-eating animals"

Shortly after planting these seedlings, the initial symptoms of the disease appear. In many cases yellow seedlings can be seen in the seedbed of Tungro attack. If there are carrier insects in the field during the period of Kushi or sheath growth after planting, the symptoms appear on the new trees. Therefore, green leafhoppers should be suppressed as soon as they appear in the seedbed and in the stage of kushi or panicle growth. The special symptom of Tungro disease is that not all the trees in the field are attacked at once. Rather sporadically some trees turn yellow at first and then die slowly",

Rice varieties have different leaf colors. No growth between leaves and stems. Infected rice plants can survive to maturity, but if the attack is severe, the plants will wither and die. In these trees the rice husk comes out partially, the grains are black and malnourished. In many cases the symptoms of the disease fade away till the rice matures in the late affected trees. Symptoms of the disease also appear on the stalks of paddy after cutting the infected rice plant",
